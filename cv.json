I love learning and developing myself. I am happiest when developing new skills and capabilities. I have learned to overcome my dyslexia by using text to speech and speech recognition tools, and developed my own shortcuts and scripts, to help me read, write and spell with greater accuracy. It may take me longer but with the emergence of new AI tools this has become far less of an issue. I am able to produce degree level material when required.",
